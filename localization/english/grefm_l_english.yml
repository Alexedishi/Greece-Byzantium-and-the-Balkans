 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main: "The Bavarocracy"
 je_grefm_bavarocracy_main_reason: "Following the collapse of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government after the assassination of #yellow Ioannis Kapodistrias#!, the [Concept('concept_great_power','$concept_great_powers$')] installed #yellow House Wittelsbach#! as sovereign over the Greek State in the hope of bringing stability to the young nation. However, since taking power, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has conspired to rule Greece by means of absolutism.

 je_grefm_bavarocracy_phase_constitution: "\n$TOOLTIP_DELIMITER$\n@information! When the regency council took custody of the nation for the young King Otto, promises were made to produce a constitution that would limit the power of the King and provide good governance to the people. The National Assembly impatiently awaits for the enactment of either #yellow Wealth Voting#!, #yellow Census Voting#!, or #yellow Universal Suffrage#!.

 je_grefm_bavarocracy_phase_tyranny: "\n$TOOLTIP_DELIMITER$\n@information! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has declared himself the absolute ruler of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The National Assembly has been disbanded, and the King directly chairs his privy council, routing all affairs of state through his office.

 je_grefm_greek_king_reason: ""
 je_grefm_greek_king_complete_tt: "We have elected a native King"
 
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle: "The Dedilomeni Principle"
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_reason: "After two revolts against the monarchy, the spirit of reform is widespread in Greece. Reformers have demanded that the King be mandated to appoint a government leader with a majority of political power, rather than the leader being chosen by their favor with the King."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_goal: "Maintain legitimate rule for 5 years."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_tt: "Maintain these conditions for 5 years."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_otto_alternate_tt: "This outcome of this journal will vary depending on which group of laws is implemented."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_otto_alternate_goal: "Maintain Absolutism or Reform into Democracy."
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_byzantium_alternate: "The Basileùs Autokrátōr"
 je_grefm_the_dedilomeni_principle_byzantium_alternate_reason: "Byzantium has been resurrected and with it the legacy of four millenia of Greek administrative tradition. As the Greek state reogranizes itself around the imperial court, politicans and citizens alike anxiously await to see what form the Imperial administration will take."
 je_grefm_the_military_league: "The Military League"
 je_grefm_the_military_league_reason: "Motivated by the dream of enosis with Crete and a greater union with Greeks beyond our borders, a band of militarists has hatched a plan to overthrow the government and place themselves in charge. Should they succeed, they intend to reogranize the Greek state to further the cause of the Megali Idea."
 je_grefm_the_military_league_goal: "The Military League is preparing..."
 
 je_grefm_venizelism_main: "Venizelism"
 je_grefm_venizelism_main_reason: "Eleftherios Venizelos is at the helm, and an era of wild change has begun in the Greek state. With the people in a nationalistic furvor, Venizelos and his supporters aim to bring Greece onto the world stage with little to no regard for the whims of the Great Powers. #italic Ankyra! Ankyra!#!"
 je_grefm_venizelism_tt1: "Develop Greek Nationalism."

 je_grefm_venizelism_tt5: "Implement Educational Initiatives"
 je_grefm_venizelism_civics: "Venizelism: Civic Rejuvenation"
 je_grefm_venizelism_civics_reason: "The Greek State has come a long way since independence from the Ottoman Empire. Now, with renewed motivation from Venizelos, the revisionists hope to build the state apparatus into a system capable of rivaling those of Western Europe."
 je_grefm_venizelism_military: "Venizelism: Military Rejuvenation"
 je_grefm_venizelism_military_reason: "Little memory remains of the semi-formal #italic Evzones#! units that were hastily assembled during the Greek Revolution. As planners look forward towards a future in which Greece has a voice in the Balkans, it has become clear that a disciplined and capable army will be essential in securing this outcome."
 je_grefm_venizelism_society: "Venizelism: Societal Rejuvenation"
 je_grefm_venizelism_society_reason: "In many ways, Greek social norms reflect centuries of conservative pressures from both the Ottoman state and the Orthodox Church. Intellectuals argue that Greece must shed these feudal relics in order to leap into the modern age."
 je_grefm_venizelism_education: "Venizelism: Academic Rejuvenation"
 je_grefm_venizelism_education_reason: "While ambitious, the education reforms put forward by the Venizelists aim to bring to the Greek people up to the forefront of academic standards."
 je_grefm_venizelism_constitution: "Venizelism: Constitutional Reform"
 je_grefm_venizelism_constitution_reason: "In the wake of Venizelos' arrival in Greece, the Constituent faction in the National Assembly pushed for the complete abolition of the Monarchy."

 je_grefm_venizelism_humanities_reason: ""
 
 
 je_grefm_greek_nationalism: "Greek Nationalism"
 je_grefm_greek_nationalism_reason: "The Greek people have existed for millennia, yet never has a truly Greek state ever come into existence. From the Greek city-state of antiquity to the multi-ethnic Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, the Greek populace have never held a state that they valued over their own home villages and regions. Spearheaded by Enlightenment thought, movements have sprung up to unite the Greek people under a truly common identity."
 je_grefm_greek_nationalism_complete_tt: "Has embraced a national identity"
 je_grefm_hellenic_nationalism: "Hellenic Nationalism"
 je_grefm_hellenic_nationalism_reason: "The Greek people have existed for millennia, yet never has a truly Greek state ever come into existence. From the Greek city-state of antiquity to the multi-ethnic Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, the Greek populace have never held a state that they valued over their own home villages and regions. Spearheaded by Enlightenment thought, movements have sprung up to unite the Greek people under a truly common identity." # This loc is temporarily copied over; this journal will be reworked in phases

 je_grefm_roman_nationalism_complete_tt: "We have formed #bold Byzantium#!"
 
 je_grefm_national_language: "A National Language"
 je_grefm_national_language_reason: "Separated by time, distance, and empires, the greater Greek populations have each diverged from the Greek languages that were spoken during the pre-Ottoman times. Scholars today have been engaged in a deep argument whether the Turkic intrusions into the Greek language, or any deviation from Koine Greek, should be tolerated at all."
 je_grefm_national_language_complete_tt: "Support for any dialect is over #bold 100#!"
 je_grefm_archaeology: "Greek Cultural Roots"
 je_grefm_archaeology_reason: "Ruins of pre-historic and ancient Greek civilizations lie scattered across the Balkans and Anatolia. As Greeks, it falls to us to reclaim these relics of our heritage."

 je_grefm_megali_idea: "The Megali Idea"
 je_grefm_megali_idea_reason: "The Greek World once stretched from the hills of the Balkans to the shores of the Levantine Sea. Across the Mediterranean, Greek peoples call for union with the Greek state. We will see the Greek realm restored."
 je_grefm_megali_idea_complete: "We will have the option to form the #bold Hellenic Empire#!"
 je_grefm_scions_of_rhomania: "Scions of Rhomania"
 je_grefm_scions_of_rhomania_reason: ""
 je_grefm_scions_of_rhomania_complete:  "We will have the option to form the #bold Roman Empire#!"
 je_grefm_greater_greece: "Greater Greece"
 je_grefm_greater_greece_reason: "The Megali Idea has been brought to fruition, but only in its most basic form. Several Greek communities still lie beyond our borders. We have an imperative to see to it that our borders grow until every Greek may find shelter within the Greek state."
 je_grefm_grecoturkism: "Helleno-Turkism"
 je_grefm_grecoturkism_reason: "Despite the insults we have inflicted upon each other after centuries of Imperial rule, we have determined that the only way forward for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is to embrace the shared hertiage between Greek and Turk. While our cultures are familiar to ech other, this process will take time."
 je_grefm_grecoturkism_goal: "This process will take time..."
 
 je_grefm_the_womens_journal: "The Women's Journal"
 je_grefm_the_womens_journal_reason: "Spearheaded by Kalliroi Parren and backed by the greater Feminism movement, women across the Greek state yearn for better treatment. Historically seen as little more than housewives, women seek their own role in advancing the nationalist cause of the Greek people. The publication, #italic The Women's Journal#!, has acted as a herald for this movement putting forth the ideas that women should own their own property and that children should be taken off the factory floors."
 
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey: "Corinth Canal Survey"
 je_grefm_corinth_canal_survey_reason: "The survery of the Corinth Canal is underway. Engineers are optimistic about plans to realize the millennia-old dream of cutting a channel across the isthimus."

 je_grefm_land_reclaimation: "Lake Kopais Reclamation"
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation_reason: "The Kopais Plain was a fertile land in antiquity. With our industrial might, we will see it restored to productivity. Currently, we estimate water levels have dropped by #blue [GetGlobalVariable('grefm_lake_kopais_var').GetValue]/3#!."
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation_goal: "Draining the lakebed will take several years. Events will notify you of progress."
 je_grefm_land_reclaimation_status: "Reclamation of the lakebed is underway..."
 
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_main: "Greek Separatism"
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_main_reason: "Greek populations extend from their heartlands in Attica, Thessaly, and the Aegean islands to marginal populations reaching into the Levantine and Black Seas. With the rise of nationalism and the Independence of the Greek State, these peoples have begun to yearn for union with the nacent Greek nation. With our support, they may be able to take up arms against their oppressors."
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_crete_status: "The #greece Cretan Revolt#! has #bold #tooltippable #tooltip:[GetRawTextTooltipTag('grefm_crete_progress_tt')] [GetGlobalVariable('grefm_crete_revolt_var').GetValue]/200#!#!#! momentum."
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_sub: "Greek Separatism"
 je_grefm_greek_separatism_sub_reason: "Greek populations extend from their heartlands in Attica, Thessaly, and the Aegean islands to marginal populations reaching into the Levantine and Black Seas. With the rise of nationalism and the Independence of the Greek State, these peoples have begun to yearn for union with the nacent Greek nation. If we fail to keep them placated, they may take up arms against us."
 
 je_grefm_revenge_of_the_greeks: "The Revenge of the Greeks"
 je_grefm_revenge_of_the_greeks_reason: "The Byzantine heartlands once stretched across both the Balkans and Anatolia. We will restore our dominion over these lands."
 je_grefm_revenge_of_the_greeks_complete_tt1: "Directly or indirectly control 10 or more states in the Balkans."
 je_grefm_revenge_of_the_greeks_complete_tt2: "Directly or indirectly control 9 or more states in Anatolia."
 je_grefm_shores_of_phoenicia: "The Shores of Phoenicia"
 je_grefm_shores_of_phoenicia_reason: "Phoenicia, an ancient name for the land known as the Levant, once linked the ancient Greek world to the eastern centers of civilization in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Once a part of the easternmost Roman Empire, these lands have languished under centuries of Muslim rulers."
 je_grefm_shores_of_phoenicia_status: "Reassert [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] control over the Near East."
 je_grefm_lands_of_arianon: "The Lands of Arianōn"
 je_grefm_lands_of_arianon_reason: "At the height of Greek influence, two successive Greco-Iranian Empires stretched across the Iranian plateau. It falls to use to reclaim these lands from their Islamic overlords."
 je_grefm_the_graveyard_of_empires: "The Graveyard of Empires"
 je_grefm_the_graveyard_of_empires_reason: "Just over two millennia ago, Alexander the Great's armies thundered across Eurasia, bringing lands past the Hindu Kush into the Greek sphere. For centuries after, Greek kingdoms rose and fell, ensuring Greek influence as far as the Indus River. Even later, the followers of Nestorius brought their heretical teachings to these lands. Now, the Empire will see these lands prosper under the Greek state."
 
 je_grefm_black_sea: "Imperial Ambition: Éfxinos Póndos"
 je_grefm_black_sea_reason: "The Black Sea was once entirely within the Greek sphere. We will bring relief to our people that still call its shores home."
 je_grefm_magna_graecia: "Imperial Ambition: Megálē Hellás"
 je_grefm_magna_graecia_reason: "Once one of the heartlands of Greek culture, southern Italy saw the mixing of Greek and Roman culture throughout antiquity."
 je_grefm_alexandria_oxus: "The Foundings: Alexandria on the Oxus"
 je_grefm_alexandria_oxus_reason: "Considered by contemporaries as the "Fathest Alexandria," Alexandria on the Oxus represented the furthest intrusion of Greek influence towards the realm of Chinese influence."
 je_grefm_alexandria_merv: "The Foundings: Alexandria in Margiana"
 je_grefm_alexandria_merv_reason: "Founded as an oasis stop, the city of Merv has a long history stretching beyond written records. Renamed after Alexander for a time, this represented the northernmost extent of Greek influence into Central Asia."
 je_grefm_alexandria_indus: "The Foundings: Alexandria on the Indus"
 je_grefm_alexandria_indus_reason: "A ruined citadel mound at the junction of the Indus and Acesines Rivers is the last reminder of a colony town founded by Alexander for the purpose of settling Thracian veterans. While little remains of the city itself, the ruin is a testament to the farthest extension of Greek influence into India."
 je_grefm_alexandria_susiana: "The Foundings: Alexandria in Susiana"
 je_grefm_alexandria_susiana_reason: "The relative backwater of city of Shush does little to indicate its long history. Once known as Susiana, the city once contended for supremacy over the lower Zagros mountains during the Bronze Age. After his conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, Alexander hosted a series of mass weddings between Macedonian and Persian nobles to secure his claim to the throne of Persia."
 
 je_grefm_ion_xenocracy: "The Xenocracy"
 je_grefm_ion_xenocracy_reason: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has seen countless overlords come and go, from their initial conquest by the Romans two millenia ago, the Heptanese have changes hands several times, although they avoided conquest by the Ottoman Empire. Since 1815, the island have been administered as a protectorate of the British Empire. Under the ausipices of High Commissioner [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], Philhellenes across the Empire have sought to model the islands into an ideal colony, in line with British successes across their realm."
 je_grefm_ion_venetian_legacy: "A Venetian Legacy"
 je_grefm_ion_venetian_legacy_reason: "The Heptanese came under Venetian rule in the 13th century after they were taken from the ailing Byzantine Empire. The Venetians brought with them medieval farming practices which widely replaced ancient farming practices. Since then, agriculture has remained unchanged across the islands, with output having declined following successive conflicts between the [Concept('concept_great_power', '$concept_great_powers$')] and disruptions from the #bold Greek War of Independence#!. With renewed attention from Philhellenes in London, local leaders have begun to push for a coordinated reform of farming practices across the islands."
 je_grefm_ion_poverty: "Poorhouses and Sanitation"
 je_grefm_ion_poverty_reason: "In the wake of the #bold Greek War of Independence#!, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have been inundated with refugees from the mainland. Lacking both industry and agriculture, the state has struggled to meet the needs of the poor. In keeping with his mandate, the High Commissioner has formed a committee with the express goal of providing outreach programs to aid the destitute."
 je_grefm_ion_jewry: "The Jewry of the Ionian Islands"
 je_grefm_ion_jewry_reason: "The [GetCulture('shepardic').GetName] Jews have a long history on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. From the first arrivals during the Second Temple era and Roman rule, to migrations from explusions at the hands of Catholicism, the #bold Heptanese#! host a vibrant [GetReligion('jewish').GetName] community.\n\nWhile their rights have varied over the course of Byzantine, Venetian, and French rule, the Jewry have been accustomed to co-existence with the [GetCulture('greek').GetName] [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] community. However, their position has taken a sudden turn with the passing of the Islands to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetPowerBloc.GetName]. With the majority of Jews exluded from the state, many have begun to protest their unwarranted second-class status.\n\nCurrently, #bold #green [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('grefm_samos_loyalist_jews_var').GetValue]%#!#! of our #yellow Sephardic#!

[concept_pop]#o s#! are [concept_radical]."
 je_grefm_ion_jewry_complete_tt1: "The total [concept_timed_modifier] for #yellow Sephardic#! [concept_pop]#o s#! [concept_sol] is #bold #green +4#! or greater#!."
 je_grefm_ion_jewry_complete_tt2: "Over #bold #green 75%#!#! of our #yellow Sephardic#! [concept_pop]#o s#! are [Concept('concept_loyalist','$concept_loyal$')]."
 je_grefm_ion_jewry_fail_tt: "Over #bold #red 75%#!#! of our #yellow Sephardic#! [concept_pop]#o s#! are [concept_radical]."
 
 je_grefm_samos_main: "Samos in Servitude"
 je_grefm_samos_main_reason: "When #yellow Greece#! took up arms in the #bold Greek War of Independence#!, they were joined by rebellions on the many smaller islands of the Aegean. Among them was the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], which defied the Ottoman state by refusing to submit to terms that would have seen them reintegrated into the Empire. Their defiance gained recognition from the [Concept('concept_great_power', '$concept_great_powers$')], who intervened to secure the island's autonomy from the #bold Sublime Porte#!.\n\nPresently, the islands are nominally ruled by a #italic bey#! appointed by the Sultan, although the government of the island has its independence in all but name. With their union with #yellow Greece#! denied, the islanders are hopeful for a time when their cruel separation from their Greek cousins will come to an end.\n\n[Country.GetCustom('grefm_samos_support_type')]"
 je_grefm_samos_main_status_1: "Lord [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] rules with an iron fist."

 je_grefm_samos_organic_law: "The Organic Law of Samos"
 je_grefm_samos_organic_law_reason: "The socioeconomic state of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] reflects its centuries of domination by the Ottoman state. In their defense of the small island, the [Concept('concept_great_power', '$concept_great_powers$')] secured the promulgation of an Organic Charter from the Sultan in exchange for the submission of the island to the #bold Sublime Porte#!. However, the implementation of these administrative functions has been left to the islanders themselves."
 
 je_grefm_purple_pheonix: "The Purple Pheonix"
 je_grefm_purple_pheonix_reason: "The lands of the [GetCulture('rhomaios').GetName] once stretched across both the Balkans and Anatolia. With the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] reborn, we will once again secure our dominion over these lands."

 je_grefm_renovatio_imperii_romanorum_dalmatia: "Reclaim Dalmatia"
 je_grefm_renovatio_imperii_romanorum_dalmatia_reason: "The Coast of Dalmatia represented one of the earliest forms of Roman expansion beyond Italy. Conquered by the Goths and later Slavs, today the Habsburg rulers maintain sovereignty over these formerly Roman lands."
 je_grefm_renovatio_imperii_romanorum_tt2: "Secure the Coasts of Dalmatia."
 je_grefm_renovatio_imperii_romanorum_northern_italy: "Reclaim Lombardia"
 je_grefm_renovatio_imperii_romanorum_northern_italy_reason: "Lost to the Lombards, and now the French, northern Italy once formed the bulwark that protected Rome from the Germanic barbarians."

 je_grefm_renovatio_imperii_romanorum_tt5: "Secure the Exarchate of Ravenna."
 
 je_grefm_constantinople: "The 14 Regions of Constantinople"
 je_grefm_constantinople_reason: "The city of Constantinople was once the greatest city of the Middle Ages, unrivalled in development anywhere in Europe. While the Queen of Cities has stagnated since the Turkish conquests, the center of the Greek world is once more in Greek hands. Drawing inspiration from early Byzantine writers, civic leaders have pushed for an urban renewal to bring Constantinople to the heights seen under the great Eastern Roman Emperors."
 je_grefm_constantinople_tt: "We have completed the #bold Byzantine Restoration#!."
 je_grefm_mega_palation_survey: "Palace Ruins Survey"

 je_grefm_mega_palation_survey_goal: "Wait for the survey to complete..."
 je_grefm_byzantine_nationalism: "Byzantine Nationalism"
 je_grefm_byzantine_nationalism_reason: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] once existed as a multi-ethnic country bound together by the [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] faith and the apparatus of the state. While [GetCulture('greek').GetName] was the language of the state, the various peoples of the Empire were treated as equal assuming they professed the faith and abided by the laws of Constantinople. We cannot consider the Empire truly reforged until we have restored this aspect of the state."
 
 je_grefm_bul_megali_idea: "The Throne of the East"
