 grefm.001.d: "In the aftermath of gaining independence, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] fell into poltical instability, culminating in the assassination of Governor #yellow Ioannis Kapodistrias#!. To stave off a collapse into civil war, the [Concept('concept_great_power','$concept_great_powers$')] installed a Bavarian Catholic King to govern over the reconstituted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\n\nThe young King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has recently come of age, but finds his ascent to the throne marred by the political intrigues of his "Arch-Chancellor" [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_landowners',GetPlayer).GetLeader.GetFullName] who has amassed personal control over the Greek political system."

However, many continue to call for further reductions in the power and status of the nobility and the elevation of Greece into a beacon of hope for Greek peoples abroad."
 grefm.002.f: "We did not fight to overthrow our Turkish oppressors just to replace them with German ones."

 grefm.003.d: "When [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFirstName] arrived to take the Greek crown, many hoped he would bring an age of prosperity to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Instead, he has focused on ruling as an autocrat, against the will of the Greek people. Infuriated with the absent pace of reforms by the royal offices, [SCOPE.sCharacter('ig_armed_forces_scope').GetFullName] has rallied the military and demanded the installation of a formal constitution to limit the power of the crown and grant rights to the citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.003.f: ""After a little while, the door of the balony of the palace opened, the king appeared and addressed himself to Kallergis: 'General Kallergis.'But the latter replied, 'Not general, merely ciziten.' After these words there followed the following shout by the army and assembled multitude, 'Long live the constitution. Long live Kallergis.' 'Your Majesty,' shouted Kallergis, 'the people want a constitution.' Then the king withdrew." - C. Neeser, in his memoirs"

You have been a victim of men who, in order to undo the work of the Revolution and to restore the old regime of corruption, have not hesitated to traffic the people's reverence for the Crown and their devotion to your person. You have been the victim finally of your own quite human and not unnatural weakness. Accustomed to admire everything German, bewildered by the unrivalled German organization of military and other affairs of every sort, you not only expected a German victory, but you came to desire it, hoping that it would enable you to concentrate in your own hands all the authority of the government, and substantially to set aside our free Constitution.""

In a sudden action, the military, led by [SCOPE.sCharacter('ig_armed_forces_scope').GetFullName], has seized the capital and deposed the King. The deposed [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFirstName] has fled into exile to [SCOPE.sState('bavaria_state_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] with the help of [SCOPE.sCountry('uk_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] naval forces.

 grefm.009.t: "A Disgraced Tyrant"
 grefm.009.d: "The royal court and political structure supporting the King has collapsed. Riding to the Royal Palace, [SCOPE.sCharacter('armed_forces_leader_scope').GetFullName] has seized [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and secured passage of a constitution. While the King expected to hold out against the coup, his Council had already drawn up the document well before the uprising was declared."
 grefm.009.f: ""I have given up all my privileges; I am no longer king; now that my ministers, the national assembly and a constitution have been imposed upon me and now that my army has stopped obeying me. In Greece, constitution means nothing more nor less than pillage." -Otto of Greece, 1843"

 grefm.010.t: "Constitutional Promises"
 grefm.010.d: "When the regency council took custody of Greece for the young King, it was with the promise that a formal constitution would be established to define the limits of royal authority. Presently, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] rules with absolute authority with no structure in place to seek redress against abuses of power and the Ottoman-era gentry have stonewalled attempts to impose taxation. The King himself has shown no interest in accepting reform and has indicated adherence to the words of his father that "a constitution is a lion's den from which no footsteps emerge.""
 grefm.010.f: ""...but as it is today, 1835, the Greek state with a limited area, with population thinning, poverty, homelessness and foreign regency, how can it to hope for its rapid development and for future prosperity and progress? The leader and administrator of our public affairs, a foreigner, however good and loyal he may be, will seek his individual advantage above all else and will strive with all his might to establish an independent and proud existence in his country from our sweat and intolerance, because according to natural reason, he can have no other sympathy in favor of his (foreign) land, but that of individual interest." -L. Kountouriotis , 1835"
 grefm.010.a: "Something must be done."
 grefm.011.t: "An Ottoman Legacy"
 grefm.011.d: "Despite freedom from Ottoman rule, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s underdeveloped government apparatus has left several relics of Turkish tax policy in place. Coupled with a lack of intervention from the crown, nearly all of the Greek state's funding is drawn from the already destitute peasantry."
 grefm.011.f: ""...agriculture is here in the most undeveloped condition. Even in the immediate neighborhood of Athens it is common to find the wooden plow and the rude mattock which were in use 2,000 years ago. Fields are plowed up or scratched over, and crops replanted season after season, until the exhausted soil will bear no more. Fertilizers are not used to any appreciable extent, and the farm implements are of the very rudest description. Irrigation is in use in some districts, and, as far as I can ascertain, the methods in use can be readily learned by a study of the practices of the ancient Egyptians. Greece has olives and grapes in abundance, and of quality not excelled; but Greek olive oil and Greek wine will not bear transportation." -W. Moffet, American Consul in Athens, 1889"
 grefm.011.a: "Unfortunate circumstances."

 grefm.013.d: "Local leaders in [SCOPE.sState('brigandage_state').GetName] have executed several alleged brigands in the name of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] following their arrest for brigandage. The informality of the legal process and brutality of the executions have drawn attention to the disorder in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 grefm.013.f: "Since the administration of Ioannis Kapodistrias, local cheiftains and irregular military units have ravaged the countryside. Descended from the armatoles of the Ottoman era, then called up during several failed insurrections against the regency, these would-be soldiers now refuse regular work. \n\nWithout support from the central government, many local leaders and landholders have turned to military tribunals to restore order. Thus far, this has been tolerated by the royal government, which has been more concerned with playing political factions against each other to prevent challenges to royal authority."
 grefm.013.a: "There must be a better way."
 grefm.014.t: "The End of the Brigands"
 grefm.014.d: "Firm and decisive leadership from the state has led to the bandits ravaging our countryside putting down their weapons and taking up work as productive members of society."
 grefm.014.f: "While a basic and mundane thing, ensuring the safety of our countrymen at home is an important step in legitimizing the state."
 grefm.014.a: "Justly done."
 grefm.015.t: "Rampant Corruption"
 grefm.015.d: "Ever since independence, the majority of high-ranking positions in government have been filled by members of select noble families and personal friends of the King. The repeated sidelining of Greek politicians and divisions sown during the regency have left Greece with a government that lacks cohesion or motivation. Prominent leaders have called for the reform of the corrupt and dynastic nature of the government along with the inclusion of more Greek-native politicians in government."
 grefm.015.f: ""...transition of the Viceroyalty to the country of its temporary residence and the beginning of its governmental duties, flocked, as a follow-up to it, and especially from Bavaria, a flock of drones who did not have universal virtues and the true enthusiasm for our common things, as those in in favor of our independence, self-styled philhellenes, occupied public positions with the favor and protection of the new power and took, so to speak, the bread of existence from the mouths of the Greek fighters." -P. Papanaoum, 1851"
 grefm.015.a: "We will see what can be done."
 grefm.016.t: "An Honorable Regime"
 grefm.016.d: "The provision of elections for large portions of the government bureaucracy has dragged the government forward from the Ottoman's medieval legacy."
 grefm.016.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] may hem and haw, but the only way forward for Greece is to leave behind the trappings of absolutism."
 grefm.016.a: "For the good of the state."
 grefm.017.t: "The Royal Bavarian Auxiliary Corps"
 grefm.017.d: "When King Otto arrived in 1832 he was accompanied by a force of 3500 Bavarian soldiers to solidify his rule. In the time since, they have found themselves unable to assimilate to life in Greece, speaking neither the language nor having access to the comforts of home the pervasively rural Greek state. With expenses mounting and their use in putting down rebellions, their presence wears on the Greek populace."
 grefm.017.f: ""The foreign auxiliary troops cost money, without doing much", while the "insistence on European clothing and armament in the army have removed the most usable people from military service and made them into disgruntled men." -Anton von Prokesch-Osten, Austrian Diplomat"
 grefm.017.a: "They serve at the pleasure of the King." 
 grefm.018.t: "Bavarian Forces Depart [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 grefm.018.d: "Bending to the calls of reformers, [SCOPE.sCharacter('king_otto_scope').GetFullName] has dismissed the Royal Bavarian Auxiliaries back to Bavaria."
 grefm.018.f: "While necessary to save the finances of the state, our army will take some time to reorganize itself with a fully-Greek officer corps." 
 grefm.018.a: "A Necessary Choice."
 grefm.019.t: "The Return of the "Turk-Eater""
 grefm.019.d: "In a supreme act of celemency, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has pardoned #gold Nikitaras#! from his imprisonment and charged him with aid in the defense of the nation. A famed fighter during the Greek War of Independence, he was known for his aggressive actions towards Turkish soldiers, earning him the nickname "Turkophagos" or "Turk-Eater." Armed with a sword and pardons for previously speaking out against the regency, our rivals would do well to fear him."
 grefm.019.f: ""I have only my sword, and that I gladly give for my country." -N. Stamatelopoulos, 1826" 
 grefm.019.a: "He will serve [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] well."
 
 grefm.020.t: "The Brigands Raid Again"
 grefm.020.d: "Brigands have raided the countryside in [SCOPE.sState('brigandage_state').GetName], renewing cries for state action."
 grefm.020.f: "Disillusioned irregulars have seized on weak government control and police corruption to rob and pillage both laborer and gentry alike. Withdrawing as quickly as they arrived, local chieftans have found several villages raided and burned."

 grefm.022.d: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] lacks much as a young monarch, but chief among them is both a queen and an heir. The young King has accompanied his father, King [SCOPE.sCharacter('ludwig_scope').GetFirstName] back to [SCOPE.sState('bavaria_state_scope').GetName] with the aim of finding an acceptable consort."
 grefm.022.f: "While the struggle with Lord [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_landowners',GetPlayer).GetLeader.GetFullName] has gone mostly unnoticed by the people, they have taken issue with the lack of an heir to the throne. The King has delegated state functions to his council, but many are concerned that the regent will be quick to expand his power base  once the monarch leaves."
 grefm.022.a: "Long live the King."
 grefm.023.t: "A Consort Fit for a Bavarian"
 grefm.023.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s return to Bavaria has been filled with pomp and circumstance as his father seeks a suitable match for the young king. A strong match has been found in the young noble, [SCOPE.sCharacter('queen_amalia_scope').GetFirstName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('oldenburg_scope').GetName], althought alternative candidates have been put forward."
 grefm.023.f: ""The Queen was small, beautiful and with a lovely figure. She was lively, almost too lively, spoke of various subjects and complimented Greece in favor of the Nordic countries, and was certain that we would very soon be accustomed to this beautiful nation with its lovely climate." -C. Lüth, regarding Queen Amalia, 1839"
 grefm.023.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('queen_amalia_scope').GetFirstName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('oldenburg_scope').GetName] is an exemplary match."
 grefm.023.tt: "This is the historical option."
 grefm.024.t: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s Intellect Challenged"
 grefm.024.d: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has been made aware of a disturbing plot by Lord [SCOPE.sCharacter('armansperg_scope').GetLastName]. Ever since the King's departure from Greece, the Arch-Chancellor has been secretly sending letters to King [SCOPE.sCharacter('ludwig_scope').GetFirstName] accusing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] of being both deranged and feeble-minded."
 grefm.024.f: "In the King's absence, Lord Armansperg has centralized political power about himself and has begun a ploy to have himself installed as a permanant regent over the Greek state."
 grefm.024.a: "This is an outrage!"
 grefm.025.t: "Discharging the Regency"
 grefm.025.d: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has returned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to find the Regency Council and National Assembly divided and in disarray at the hands of Lord [SCOPE.sCharacter('armansperg_scope').GetLastName]'s interference. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] now faces pressure from abroad to bring order to the Greek state and legitimize Bavarian rule. In light of this, political leaders demand a resolution to this political crisis."
 grefm.025.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is poor, rural, and dependent on the great powers.  The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] was accepted eagerly by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people, but every day that passes without reform and without prosperity steadily undermines his authority and tests the patience of the Great Powers."

 grefm.026.t: "The Philorthodox Conspiracy"
 grefm.026.d: "A disturbing plot has been exposed in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]. Conspirators, backed by Bishop [SCOPE.sCharacter('devout_leader_scope').GetFullName] and aided by the #yellow Philorthodox Society#!, have launched a scheme to hold the King at arms and secure the royal family's conversion to the [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] faith."
 grefm.026.f: "The [GetCulture('greek').GetName] people are unquestioningly entwined with [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] Christianity and this has manifested in a tide of xenophobia. Every day, contingents of preist and peasant alike fear that securing an [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] ruler may be the best hope for halting the decline of the Church's influence."

 grefm.030.d: "With the ousting of the Bavarian Monarchy, the custodian government has called for a plebsebite to determine the best candidate for the throne. However, this has proved problematic with the most popular candidates being unwilling or politically unable to take the crown. It has fallen to the caretaker government to appoint a new ruler."
 grefm.030.f: "The rulers of Greece vastly overestimated the value of the Greek crown to outsiders. Noble after noble passed on ruling the backwards nation. The most popular candidates were disqualified due to connections to the British, French, or Russian royal families."

 grefm.032.d: "In keeping with their continual frustration with the monarchy, reformist [SCOPE.sCharacter('intelligentsia_leader_scope').GetFullName] has penned an inflammatory article denouncing the monarch as favoring his friends as prime ministers as opposed to politicians with genuine popular backing. The article has been seized upon by supporters and detractors as both a valid criticism of the Greek state and a grievous affront to the Crown." 
 grefm.032.f: ""If the people are not at fault, the politicians are at fault, others say, and the nation is responsible for their corruption, since they belong to the nation. We answer that the conduct of the statesmen would be the responsibility of the nation, if Greece were self-governing, but since through the perversion of the Constitution and the virtuality of the Parliament, Greece is indeed governed as an absolute monarchy, it was next that the statesmen whom the illegitimate regime propagates should also become at fault." -K.

 grefm.143.a: "Excellent work."
 grefm.144.t: "Parthenon Site Excavated"
 grefm.144.d: "The abandoned mosque has been demolished and the site cleared at the Parthenon. Under the supervision of Architect Nikolaos Balanos, the shattered remains of the Parthenon have been identified and reassembled using iron and concrete for structural reinforcement."
 grefm.144.f: "The first restoration of the Parthenon was a monumental achievement for the Archaeological Service. However, the techniques used by Balanos have been heavily criticized.

 grefm.145.f: "Until the formal excavations at Knossos, the role of Crete in the Minoan civilization was unclear. With the discovery of the palace complex, the city's position at the heart of the Minoan Civilization was confirmed. Excavations would continue from 1900-1931 with several phases of restorations.

 grefm.146.t: "Minoan Palace Restored"

 grefm.146.f: "While impressive, the "reconstitution" of the palace has been criticized as Evans applied a large amount of creative license to his reconstructions, sometimes added embellishments that weren't attested or worse later proven to be incorrect."
 grefm.146.a: "Excellent news!"
 grefm.147.t: "Delos Surveyed"
 grefm.147.d: "With the island abandoned since Byzantine times and managed only by a small caretaker population, the "excavations" at Delos have been more of just an accounting of the various structures located at the site. Several temples and social centers survive in remarkable condition."

Alongside that came populations of Jews, Pagans, Christians, and Muslims, giving the island an incredible variety of culutral influences. However, despite the numerous finds, the supervising ephor was disappointed to announce that no signs of the fabled Colossus of Rhodes have been found."
 grefm.149.f: ""To you, O Sun, the people of Dorian Rhodes set up this bronze statue reaching to Olympus, when they had pacified the waves of war and crowned their city with the spoils taken from the enemy. Not only over the seas but also on land did they kindle the lovely torch of freedom and independence.

 grefm.241.d: "Since independence, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_intelligentsia_scope').GetName] has pushed for the adoption of a variety of Greek called "Katharevousa". The people continue to use "Dimotikí", or vulgar Greek, with each region having its own local variation of the Greek language. Concurrently, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('ig_devout_scope').GetName] continues to use "Koine" Greek, a liturgical dialect with continuity back to the Hellenistic period."
 grefm.241.f: "Historical Note: The problem of which dialect of Greek to promote to national status was a heavily debated issue up to 1976. For millennia, the Greek language has existed along a continuum, like most languages before the advent of modern schooling and nation-states. The arrival of the Seljuk Turks carved physical divisions between various Greek populations, allowing many dialects to diverge to a point of being nearly unintelligible to each other."
 grefm.241.a: "Our language will bind us together."
 grefm.242.t: "A National Language"
 grefm.242.d: "Through academic rigor and the will of the state, national leaders are ready to organize a national curriculum for the Greek language. While this won't resolve the language problem overnight, we can at least ensure a consistent linguistic education for our children across the Greek state."
 grefm.242.f: "As the Greek literary landscape grows, Katharevousa has been disproportionately favored by writers and politicians alike. Many fear that further pushing the Greek language backwards in time will only further alienate the populace and impede education access for the masses. Conversely, many hold that purifying the language of Slavic and Turkish "contamination" will allow educators to refine the otherwise uncouth masses."
 grefm.242.a: "Dimotikí is the true language of the people."

 grefm.243.d: "The large strides made by the Archaeological Society have given the Greek people a sense of presence in the Balkans back into prehistoric times. Every month, more of the people speak of the Greek state as if it has existed through the eras, going as far as conflating the modern state with the Byzantine and Roman administrations that preceded the Ottomans."
 grefm.243.f: "Thanks to our scholars, we can say without question that the "proto-Greeks" arrived in the Balkans well before recorded history and have been here ever since. Be they in the hands the pre-Roman city-states, the Byzantine Empire, or the Venetian and Ottoman oppressors, these land have been and always will remain Greek."
 grefm.243.a: "We have always been here."
 grefm.244.t: "The History of the Greek Nation"
 grefm.244.d: "Following decades of academic rigor, Constantine Paparrigopoulos has published the last volume of his work #italic History of the Hellenic Nation#!. A remarkably vivid and elegant accounting of Greek history, his work is the first to thread together the histories of ancient Greece, medieval Greece, and the modern Greek state into a marvelous story of Greek presence across the Balkans and Anatolia."
 grefm.244.f: "Historical note: Published in six volumes from 1860 to 1877, Paparrigopoulos' work was the first truly academic attempt to rebut the mainstream opinion that the Greek "race" had been displaced or assimilated by various Slavic peoples during the migration period with a complete disregard towards nearly a millennium of Byzantine domination of the Hellespont followed by a complex existence as an integral part of the fabric of the Ottoman state."
